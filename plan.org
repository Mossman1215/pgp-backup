* features
** assess folder and precalculate number of operations 
   Make sure that it fits within google requirements
** wait for some small time per file
   to keep within google limits
* Tests
** DONE upload test
   top down traversal of directory
   upload all folders in root first
   then upload files
   then process folders *looping*
** instruction test

* Hard Limits
  1000 requests per 100 seconds
  1,000,000,000 per day
* Tasks
** TODO copy structure of upload_dir_inst and merge it into upload_dir
** DONE Note hard limits
** DONE Calculate size of walk
** TODO email results

   must do a memory search to get parent ID's
   
   mapping of directories -> parentIDs
   check if root is in mapping if not it is root of all directories and set a new pID variable
