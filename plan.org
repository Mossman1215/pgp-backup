* features
** assess folder and precalculate number of operations 
   Make sure that it fits within google requirements
** wait for some small time per file
   to keep within google limits
* Tests
** DONE upload test
   top down traversal of directory
   upload all folders in root first
   then upload files
   then process folders *looping*
** DONE instruction test
   build a set of json strings to represent the required opertations to mirror the file and folder structures in google drive
** DONE instruction test 2
   modify instructions to handle parent ID's
   have a parentID as well as rootID
   root folder gets previous parentID all folders underneath get rootID
   once all folders in a level have been processed the parent id changes
   make a parent to subdirectory Mapping to keep track
   name,myID,parentID
** DONE config file test
   print config file to terminal
** TODO email test
* Hard Limits
  1000 requests per 100 seconds
  1,000,000,000 per day
* Tasks
** DONE copy structure of upload_dir_inst and merge it into upload_dir
** DONE Note hard limits
** DONE Calculate size of walk
** TODO email results ?
** DONE rebuild instructions script
   must do a memory search to get parent ID's
   
   mapping of directories -> parentIDs
   check if root is in mapping if not it is root of all directories and set a new pID variable
   or retreive pID from memory
   all subdirs must be put in the mapping as name -> pID
   upload the files with parentID = pID
   
** DONE include encryption as a module
** TODO add temporary encryption to ecnrypted_uploader
** TODO modularise existing scripts
** DONE config file
   each config file (ini) has 2 structures
       section = key -> option(s)
       option = key -> value
   use ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser()
*** folders
    temp
    oauth
*** gpg
    fingerprint
*** email settings
    address
    password
** TODO figure out the file to integrate the components into
